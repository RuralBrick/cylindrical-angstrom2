# Angstrom-method for Thermal Diffusivity Measurement using Infrared Thermography
This code process temperatures obtained from IR thermography videos, and applies a modified Angstrom method (E Lopez-Baeza et al 1987 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 20 1156) to calculate thermal diffusivity based on the recording. Here I demonstrate the how to work with Flir software, but it works for any IR software so long as you can export IR video as multiple csv files.

For details, please check the Jupyter notebook for instructions how to use this code.

A paper regarding experimental section of this code is on the way. But if you find it beneficial for your application, I encourage to cite my current paper along the original paper which for modified Angstrom method theory: Xu, Xiang, et al. "Double-negative-index ceramic aerogels for thermal superinsulation." Science 363.6428 (2019): 723-727, which shares similar ideas as the paper which used this code.
