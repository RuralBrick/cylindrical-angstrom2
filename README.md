# Angstrom-method
This code process temperatures obtained from IR thermography videos, and applies a modified Angstrom method (E Lopez-Baeza et al 1987 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 20 1156) to calculate thermal diffusivity based on the recording. Here I demonstrate the how to work with Flir software, but it works for any IR software so long as you can export IR video as multiple csv files.
